Reroute registers itself as your default browser. When any application opens
a link, Reroute either applies one of your rules silently or shows a small
picker with the browsers installed on your computer. One click, or one key,
and the link opens where you want it: work profile, private window, the
browser that has the right extensions.

It is a cross-platform re-implementation of the ideas behind
[Hurl](https://github.com/U-C-S/Hurl), written in Rust with a security-first
design and a code base small enough for one person to maintain.

</p>

## Highlights

- **Works everywhere** — Linux, Windows and macOS from one code base
  (Rust core, Tauri 2 shell, Svelte 5 interface). Native installers for each.
- **Rules that decide for you** — `domain:*.github.com`,
  `regex:^https://open\.spotify\.com/`, `exact:https://example.com/login`.
  First match wins; a rule can target a browser *profile* or a private window.
- **Remember in one click** — tick *Always use for this domain* in the picker
  and a rule is written for you.
- **Keyboard first** — `1`–`9` picks a tile, arrows move, `Enter` confirms,
  `Space` opens the profile menu, `Esc` cancels, `,` opens settings.
- **Tiles or a list** — the picker shows tiles, or a list in one or two
  columns where every name is written in full.
- **Finds your browsers** — desktop entries on Linux (including Flatpak and
  Snap), the registry on Windows, application bundles on macOS, with their
  real icons. Each browser with a private mode gets a second entry for it,
  so a private window is one click away (Flatpak browsers excepted: add
  theirs by hand, see the configuration guide).
- **Zero shell, zero telemetry** — only `http` and `https` links are
  accepted, browsers are spawned with an argument vector, and the
  configuration file is private to your user. See [the security model](docs/security.md).
- **Opens at once** — on Linux, Reroute stays in the background with its
  picker ready and starts with your session: the picker appears about a
  tenth of a second after a click. Turn it off in *Settings › General*.
- **A version check you control** — once a day when Reroute starts, the
  update button beside ⚙ in the picker turns green when you are up to date
  and takes the accent colour when a newer release is out; press it, or
  the one in *Settings › About*, for a link to the download page. Reroute
  downloads and installs nothing by itself, and the daily check can be
  turned off.
- **Plain-text configuration** — one TOML file you can edit by hand, plus an
  importer for Hurl's `UserSettings.json`.

## How it works

```
a link is clicked anywhere ──► the OS starts Reroute with the URL
                                      │
              on Linux, handed to the Reroute already running in the background
                                      │
                       URL validated (http/https only, no credentials)
                                      │
                    ┌─── a rule matches ───► browser launched
                    │
                    └─── no rule ─────────► picker window ► your choice ► launch
```

The rule path never creates a window, so links that match open as fast as
with a plain default browser. On Linux the picker is already loaded in the
background, so it appears about a tenth of a second after the click; on
Windows and macOS, Reroute starts for each link and exits after it.

## Install

Download the installer for your platform from the
[Releases](https://github.com/Gilgalidd/reroute/releases) page, install it,
open Reroute and press **Make Reroute the default** in the *General* tab.

| Platform | Package | Becoming the default |
|----------|---------|----------------------|
| Linux    | `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.AppImage` | Immediate: Reroute updates `~/.config/mimeapps.list`. Also `reroute --make-default`. |
| Windows  | `.msi`, NSIS `.exe` | Reroute registers itself and opens *Settings › Default apps*, where you select it (Windows does not let applications set themselves as default). |
| macOS    | ARM64 `.dmg`, native on Apple Silicon (M1 and later) | macOS shows its own confirmation dialog. |

Linux needs WebKitGTK 4.1 at runtime (`libwebkit2gtk-4.1-0`); the `.deb` and
`.rpm` packages declare it.

**Updating on Linux.** Reroute stays in the background, so after you install
a newer version the old one keeps running until your next login. To switch
at once, run `pkill -x reroute`: the next link you click starts the new one.

**First launch on macOS.** Reroute is not notarised by Apple, so macOS blocks
the first launch of the downloaded app. On macOS 14 and earlier, right-click
the app in Finder and choose *Open*. On macOS 15 and later, try to open it
once, then click *Open Anyway* in System Settings › Privacy & Security. This
is needed only once.

## Use

Click any link outside a browser. The picker appears with your browsers.
Right-click a tile, or press `Space`, for its launch options: a Chrome
profile, a Firefox private window, a kiosk mode, whatever you configured.

Open the settings window from the ⚙ button, by starting Reroute with no
argument, or with `reroute --settings`.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/settings.png" width="640" alt="The settings window, Rules tab: a ruleset with its browser, launch option and patterns, and a box to try a URL against the saved rules">
</p>

Command-line flags: `--settings`, `--make-default`, `--version` (`-V`), and
on Linux `--background`, which starts Reroute with no window, as the session
does at login. Anything after the URL is ignored.

## Configure

Everything lives in one TOML file:

| Platform | Path |
|----------|------|
| Linux    | `~/.config/reroute/config.toml` |
| macOS    | `~/Library/Application Support/dev.reroute.reroute/config.toml` |
| Windows  | `%APPDATA%\reroute\reroute\config\config.toml` |

```toml
version = 1

[settings]
rules_enabled = true
close_on_focus_loss = true

[[browsers]]
id = "6d1a4b1e-6a0e-4a5f-9c1b-2f0f5f2f1a11"
name = "Firefox"
path = "/usr/bin/firefox"
args = ["%URL%"]

[[browsers.launches]]
id = "0b9a3c2e-4f33-4a7c-8b0e-1c2d3e4f5a6b"
name = "Private window"
args = ["--private-window", "%URL%"]

[[rulesets]]
name = "Work"
browser = "6d1a4b1e-6a0e-4a5f-9c1b-2f0f5f2f1a11"
launch = "0b9a3c2e-4f33-4a7c-8b0e-1c2d3e4f5a6b"
patterns = ["domain:*.github.com", "regex:^https://open\\.spotify\\.com/"]
```

The full reference, including every pattern kind, is in
[docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).

## Status

Pre-1.0, used daily on Linux; Windows and macOS builds are produced by CI
and need wider testing. The configuration format is versioned (`version = 1`)
and Reroute refuses files written by a newer version rather than guessing.
